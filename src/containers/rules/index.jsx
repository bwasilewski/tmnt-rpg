      <p>The concept behind that of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is novel but not new. Over the years there have been animal characters in virtually every comic book ever created. From Cerebus the Aardvark through the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, from Superdog through the Cat in American Flagg, Bugs Bunny through Howard the Duck; there's been a fascination with animals that mimic the human form or habit. And where would Tom Terrific be without Manfred the Wonder Dog?</p>
      <p>None of this is even a modern trend. Students of Japanese art willrecognize the delightful caricatures of priests; peasants and samuraidepicted as mice, rabbits and other common animals. This game merely offers animals as characters to the many players in role-playing games.</p>
      <p>However, to get back to games, T.M.N.T. is meant to be a completerole-playing experience. You can use T.M.N.T. to play anything froma quickie tournament to a lifetime campaign. No matter how you usethe game, on its own, or with Heroes Unlimited, or even with some othercomic-style role-playing game, it should be a complete and enjoyablerole-playing experience.</p>
      <p>So how can a game based on a single set of comic book charactersbe complete? Simple; this game lays out all the rules needed to createany kind of animal character. Whether they're mutants or biologicalexperiments, the player can rollup a character that's playable and ba-lanced.</p>
      <p>Game masters will find T.M.N.T. to be complete also. Of course,any ambitious game master should take a good look at Heroes Unlimitedbefore starting a T.M.N.T. campaign. The point is, you don't NEEDanything beyond the rules in this book.</p>
      <p>One comment on the Animal Section. Yes; I know that it's incomplete. But do you have any idea how many animals there are in theworld? How many birds? We're talking about over 750 species in NorthAmerica alone. So I've pretty much concentrated on the creatures com-mon to the Eastern United States and Canada. And if you should haveany arguments with the various animal descriptions and statistics . . .welcome to the club. It's a rare day when any two expert sources agreeon anything!</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy this new expansion to the Heroes Unlimited gamesystem. I would like to thank my entire intrepid cast of playtesters,Paul Deckert, Rob Justice, Alan Moen, Greg Paul, Pete Schermerhorn, Eric Snider, John Speck, Jim Webster and Suzie Zick.</p>

      <Title isSize={3}>Random Character Generation</Title>
      <Subtitle isSize={3}>A Rationalization</Subtitle>

      <p>Some  readers  will  be  surprised  to  discover  that  there  is  a  "pointsystem" for creating the animal characters in this book.  There is a goodreason  for  it;  we  want  to  make  sure  that  every  player  could  create  ananimal  character  to  suit  themselves.  Which,  if  you  think  about  it,  isreally  not  all  that  different  from  the  way  things  are  handled  in  HeroesUnlimited.  After  all,  Bionic  and  Robotic  characters  also  build  them-selves.  But  this  game,  just  like  Heroes  Unlimited  (and  most  otherPalladium  games),  is  based  on  random  character generation.</p>
      <p>There's a fair amount of controversy in the roleplaying game commu-nity  about  character generation.  Chiefly,  some  players complain  that  itis  not  as  much  fun  or  as  challenging  to  roll  up  characters  off  a  tableas it is to 'create'  the characters.</p>
      <p>There  is  some  validity  to  the  argument.  Regardless  of our  personalopinions  on  the  subject  you  are  free  to  do  what  you  will  with  the  game.If  you  are  a  game  master,  then  simply  let  the  players  create  theircharacters  according  to your own  preferences.  If you  are  a player,  thenlobby  your  game  master  for  whatever  changes  you  feel  will  make  forthe  most  playable  game.  However,  here  are  a  few  good  reasons  toretain  the  random  character  generation  system:</p>
